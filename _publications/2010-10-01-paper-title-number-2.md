excerpt: 'Autonomous driving requires precise and efficient 3D point clouds processing techniques, where deep learning has shown great potential. Nonetheless, most of the existing works achieve high accuracy in synthetic data while performing unsatisfactorily in real-world datasets. On the other hand, though existing multi-view-based, volumetric-based, and point-based methods have achieved promising results, they still suffer from high computational complexity or low memory utilization efficiency. For example, the computational time and memory consumption of multi-view-based and volumetric-based methods increase at most cubically with the increasing of the input resolution, while half of the point-based methods’ runtime is wasted due to their irregular memory access. To address these issues, we propose a novel method to fuse complementary CNNs, dubbed as Multi-Branch Convolutional Neural Networks (MBCNN), which achieves the current state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high efficiency. The underlying design of MBCNN is to utilize the point-based convolution as a local-feature branch and spherical convolution as a global-feature branch, to capture patterns in space and exploit the merit of the pointwise Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), which is robust to the perturbation. Besides, we design an efficient voxel-based indexing technique to prevent the feature-extracting phase from being blocked, thus significantly accelerating the procedure of finding a point’s neighbor. Experimental results show that MBCNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on the real-world 3D point clouds dataset while reducing 30% of runtime in neighbor indexing.'
