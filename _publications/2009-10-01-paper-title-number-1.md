title: "Using Augmented Reality Techniques to Simulate Training and Assistance in Electric Power"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'In combination with the augmented reality (AR) technology and Hololens device, an electric power work assist system is developed to provide a more realistic and convenient training experience for electric power training. The training effect was improved, and help guidance information was provided in the actual operation of electric power work. Experimental results show that difficulty of electric power work is reduced and the efficiency of actual work is improved.'
